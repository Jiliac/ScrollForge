How to improve coherence?

- [ ] ~~Coherence agent, criticiser or orchestrator setting coherence? (Too much responsability on the orchestrator though.)~~
- [ ] Criticizer at the end of narrator call. Can either adjust and regen/continue this narration. Or just "correct" in the next call/in the files.
- [ ] Zep memory management. Within thread, and overall
- [ ] ~~Faction within conversation~~
- [ ] Memory management. **Archivist**, compress conversation? (Or implicit restart)
